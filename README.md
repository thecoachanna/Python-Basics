# Assignment: Variables and Local Python Files

So, you've just installed Python! Let's put your skills to the test.

## Learning Goals

You will practice these programming concepts we've covered in class:

* Declaring and using variables
* Using mathematical operators
* Running local `.py` files from your terminal

## Problem: Decoding R2D2

You have a robot who communicates in a series of beeps and boops. You usually get the gist of what he means, but just once it would be nice to know what's really on his mind!

You've noticed a pattern in the beeps and boops, and it seems like the number of beeps and boops correspond to specific letters.

**Example Code**

```python
beeps = 2
boops = 6
total = beeps + boops
print(total) # prints 8
```

You got a result of `8`. Now, look that up in the corresponding **key-value** chart:

|  Code | Letter | Code | Letter |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  1 | A | 14 | N |
|  2 | B | 15 | O |
|  3 | C | 16 | P |
|  4 | D | 17 | Q |
|  5 | E | 18 | R |
|  6 | F | 19 | S |
|  7 | G | 20 | T |
|  8 | H | 21 | U |
|  9 | I | 22 | V |
|  10 | J | 23 | W |
|  11 | K | 24 | X |
|  12 | L | 25 | Y |
|  13 | M | 26 | Z |

According to the chart, the first letter is `H`! It's your job to figure out the rest of the message!

Here is the full list of beeps and boops you wrote down when you were having a "conversation" with R2D2 earlier...

```
2 beeps, 6 boops
0 beeps, 5 boops
9 beeps, 3 boops
4 beeps, 8 boops
10 beeps, 5 boops
BOP! (pretty sure this is a space!)
11 beeps, 12 boops
5 beeps, 10 boops
1 beep, 17 boops
5 beeps, 7 boops
4 beeps, 0 boops
```

In a separate file, print out the numerical total for each beep-boop combo as we did above. In a comment, write the letter that the number corresponds to.

**Example Code**

```python
# H
beeps = 2
boops = 6
total = beeps + boops
print(total)
```

**Expected Output**

```
8
5
12
12
15
23
15
18
12
4
```

## Deliverables

1. **Fork** the assignment repo so that you have a copy of it that belongs to you on Github.

1. Open your Terminal and navigate to the folder for all of your development work.

1. **Clone** your copy of the assignment repo onto your computer. Remember to clone *your* version of the repo, not the instructor's version, so that you can make change to it!

1. Open the assignment folder with your code editor.

1. Write your code inside the `solution.py` file and solve the problem. Remember to **save the file** frequently.

1. Run the program from the command line to check your work against the **Expected Output** you saw earlier.

    Remember that to run a program from the command line, enter:

    ```bash
    python solution.py
    ```

    > **Protip**: You may need to use the `cd` command to navigate to the location where the `solution.py` is saved.

1. Until you get the expected output, you can make changes to your code and run it again to see if you have the answer. Repeat as needed!

    > **Hint**: Make sure you are printing something out with the `print` statement! Otherwise, you won't see any output from running your program!

1. When you're done, **commit** the changes, and **push** the changes to Github.
